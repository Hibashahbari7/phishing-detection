# 🛡️ Phishing Website Detection

A project for detecting phishing websites using data science techniques.  
Developed as part of the course *Data Science Methods in Cybersecurity* at the University of Haifa.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow applied to a real-world cybersecurity problem: identifying phishing websites based on structured, pre-engineered features.

The workflow includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature correlation analysis
- Unsupervised segmentation using KMeans clustering
- Supervised classification using Boosting (XGBoost) and Bagging (Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison
